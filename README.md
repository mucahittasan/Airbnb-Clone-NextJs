<h2> ✨ About The Project</h2>

- In this project, I made an airbnb project with "Code with antonio". I've worked with things like how to use modals in general in my project, how to use nextjs and prisma together, how to use nextjs' nextAuth package, how to signIn with github or google, and I think it's a pretty cool project.
